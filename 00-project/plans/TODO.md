# Current Tasks

Keep this file up to date as tasks involving the `00-project/` directory are completed (check off items, add changelog row or troubleshooting entry as needed).

## Reference — filing completed plans

When a plan is finished and should be archived, follow **`plans-completed/README.md`**:

1. Move the plan file from `plans/` or `build/` to **`plans-completed/<category>/`** (pick category: `implementation`, `investigation`, `migration`, `review`, or `tooling`).
2. Add a row at the top of **`plans-completed/index.md`** (Date, Category, Title, File, Notes).
3. Add a row at the top of **`changelog/index.md`** with Type=`plan` and File **`../plans-completed/<category>/<filename>`**.

**Alternate:** If you explicitly want the plan under **`changelog/plans/`** only, file there and use File `plans/...` in the changelog index.
